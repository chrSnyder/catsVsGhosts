This game pits cats against ghosts. 

Once there was a diner party at a mansion. 

To make the floors shine the hostess had them rubbed with banana peels. 

This caused the floors to be slippery and in a tragic mass slippage, the hostess and all of her wealthy guests met their ends. 

Life moved on and the house sat empty for 80 years before a pair of young zillenials moved into the place with their cat fluffykins. 

It is their first night in the house and the ghosts of the old patrons are on the attack. 

While the young couple sleeps helplessly it is up to fluffykins to hold the ghastly ghosts at bay!



Use fluffykins' night vision and super kitty hearing to locate the ghosts and use claw and bite attacks to send them packing. 

Use the growl to stun the ghosts and halt their attacks. 

Make it throught the night without fluffykins or her hoomans being taken by the ghosts to win.
